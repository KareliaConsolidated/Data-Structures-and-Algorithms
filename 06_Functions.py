# In the next exercise, you will write a function that checks sudoku squares for correctness.
# Sudoku is a logic puzzle where a game is defined by a partially filled 9 x 9 square of digits where each square contains one of the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. For this question we will generalize and simplify the game.
# Define a procedure, check_sudoku, that takes as input a square list of lists representing an n x n sudoku puzzle solution and returns the boolean True if the input is a valid sudoku square and returns the boolean False otherwise.
# A valid sudoku square satisfies these two properties:
# Each column of the square contains each of the whole numbers from 1 to n exactly once.
# Each row of the square contains each of the whole numbers from 1 to n exactly once.
# You may assume that the input is square and contains at least one row and column.

def check_sudoku(square):
    for row in square:
        # Create a list with the integers 1, 2, ..., n.
        # We will check that each number in the row is in the list
        # and remove the numbers from the list once they are verified
        # to ensure that each number only occurs once in the row.
        check_list = list(range(1, len(square[0]) + 1))
        for i in row:
            if i not in check_list:
                return False
            check_list.remove(i)
    for n in range(len(square[0])):
        # We do the same here for each column in the square.
        check_list = list(range(1, len(square[0]) + 1))
        for row in square:
            if row[n] not in check_list:
